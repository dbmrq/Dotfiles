# dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files. There are many like them, but these
ones are mine. My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must
master them as I must master my life. Without me, my dotfiles are useless.
Without my dotfiles, I am useless.

The most interesting stuff here is probably:

- [My Hammerspoon configuration](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.hammerspoon)

- [My custom zsh prompt](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions) (to use with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto))

- [My .vimrc](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vimrc),
which is split into 
    * [settings.vim](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/settings.vim)
    * [mappings.vim](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/mappings.vim)
    * [plugins.vim](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/plugins.vim)

- [My ftplugin files](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.vim/ftplugin)

- [The .bootstrap scripts](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.bootstrap)

Note to self: to bootstrap a new Mac, run something like

    git clone https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles/home/.bootstrap && ./.bootstrap.sh

That'll download and run the `.bootstrap.sh` script, which will take care of
the rest.

If you're not me, you should probably check out the contents of that file before
doing that. There's lots of stuff that wouldn't make sense for other people.
