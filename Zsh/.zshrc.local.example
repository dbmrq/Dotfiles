# Machine-specific zsh configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.zshrc.local and customize as needed

# Example: uv (Python package manager)
# [[ -f "$HOME/.local/bin/env" ]] && . "$HOME/.local/bin/env"

# Example: nvm (Node Version Manager)
# export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Example: rbenv (Ruby version manager)
# eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"

# Example: Work-specific aliases
